#### _Text encryption website, Dec 6, 2016_

#### By _**Zach Baum**_

## Description

_An exercise in writing custom PHP modules for Drupal. The user fills out a form and any text inputted is encrypted using a shift cipher, which "shifts" the alphabet left or right a number of times and replaces all the letters accordingly. All content was coded from scratch using the Drupal api, rather than using the built-in Drupal dashboard, including the menu items, pages, and forms._
